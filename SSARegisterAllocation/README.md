# Register allocation by coloring chordal graphs
This exercise is based on part of the paper [Register Allocation via Coloring of Chordal Graphs](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/publications/papers/APLAS05.pdf). Although programs may introduce an arbitrary number of variables, all software runs on an underlying CPU with a limited number of registers. This comes forth the problem of **register allocation**: given the limited amount of registers available, changing the program in order to reduce its register demand is quite useful. Figuring out how many registers are necessary for all variables in the current program is one step of solving this problem.

Variables that are simultaneously alive require concurrent registers. It is useful to build an interference graph that represents each variable as a vertex, while edges connect variables that share live time in the program:

Register assignment can be represented by coloring a vertex, thus turning the problem into an instance of graph-coloring. While discovering the chromatic number of a general graph is NP-complete, the minimum coloring of chordal (triangular) graphs can be found in linear time. 

A graph is chordal if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to CN, N>3. Fortunately, [SSA-form programs have chordal interference graphs](https://compilers.cs.uni-saarland.de/papers/ifg_ssa.pdf).

(a) and (d) are chordal graphs. (c) Is isomorphic to C4, and so is the induced subgraph of (b) containing only its corners.

## The Assignment
This lab consists in implementing the algorithm for finding the chromatic number (the minimum amount of required registers) for programs in SSA-form. By the end we will be able not only to know how many registers are required, but obtain a sample coloring (note that the exact colorings may vary on each iteration). In order to do so, the incomplete class `InterferenceGraph` is presented. This class builds the interference graph of a program, and it must contain all the logic for register allocation. Students must implement the methods `maximum_cardinality_search` and `greedy_coloring` , the two main algorithms involved in coloring chordal graphs.


Besides the `driver.py` and `lang.py` modules, the following files are required:
- A [liveness analysis](../IntroDataFlow) implementation.
- [phi functions](../PhiFunctions) should be fully implemented.

Note also that `lang.py` has been slightly modified to allow numbers to be used directly in programs. This removes the need to define all numbers as environment variables, hence reducing overlapping variables and simplifying register allocation. The parser has been purposefully omitted from this exercise as to avoid the need to adapt it to numerals as well - all programs are instantiated in python.


## Uploading the Assignment

Students enrolled in DCC888 have access to UFMG's grading system, via [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).
You must upload four python files to have your assignment graded: [driver.py](driver.py), [lang.py](lang.py), [dataflow.py](dataflow.py) and [graph.py](graph.ph)
Remember to click on "*Avaliar*" to have your assignment graded.

## Testing without Moodle

As in the previous labs, all the files in this exercise contain `doctest` comments.
You can easily test your implementation by doing, for instance:

```
python3 -m doctest lang.py
```
