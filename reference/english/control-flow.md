# Control-Flow Graphs
The first task introduces the [model language](./model-language.md). Students
must implement a [control-flow graph](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/ementa/slides/ControlFlowGraphs.pdf)
through some functions. After finishing this task, the language does not gain
any new features. The student, however, is expected to learn how it works.
